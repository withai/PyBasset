# Basset
#### Deep convolutional neural networks for DNA sequence analysis.

Basset provides researchers with tools to:

1. Train deep convolutional neural networks to learn highly accurate models of DNA sequence activity such as accessibility (via DNaseI-seq or ATAC-seq), protein binding (via ChIP-seq), and chromatin state.
2. Interpret the principles learned by the model.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Installation

Basset has a few dependencies because it uses both Torch7 and Python and takes advantage of a variety of packages available for both.

First, I recommend installing Torch7 from [here](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html). If you plan on training models on a GPU, make sure that you have CUDA installed and Torch should find it.

For the Python dependencies, I highly recommend the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). The only library missing is pysam, which you can install through Anaconda or manually from [here](https://code.google.com/p/pysam/). You'll also need [bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for data preprocessing. If you don't want to use Anaconda, check out the full list of dependencies [here](docs/requirements.md).

Basset relies on the environmental variable BASSETDIR to orient itself. In your startup script (e.g. .bashrc), write
```
    export BASSETDIR=the/dir/where/basset/is/installed
```

To make the code available for use in any directory, also write
```
    export PATH=$BASSETDIR/src:$PATH
    export PYTHONPATH=$BASSETDIR/src:$PYTHONPATH
    export LUA_PATH="$BASSETDIR/src/?.lua;$LUA_PATH"
```

To download and install the remaining dependencies, run
```
    ./install_dependencies.py
```

Alternatively, Dr. Lee Zamparo generously [volunteered his Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/lzamparo/basset/).

To download and install additional useful data, like my best pre-trained model and public datasets, run
```
    ./install_data.py
```
